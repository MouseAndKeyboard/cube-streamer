Tracks `idle:N` label on hq-deacon bead for backoff state\n\n**On signal received** (activity detected):\nReset the idle counter and start next patrol cycle:\n```bash\ngt agent state hq-deacon --set idle=0\n```\nThen return to inbox-check step.\n\n**On timeout** (no activity):\nThe idle counter was auto-incremented. Continue to next patrol cycle\n(the longer backoff will apply next time). Return to inbox-check step.\n\n**Why this approach?**\n- Any `gt` or `bd` command triggers beads activity, waking the Deacon\n- Idle towns let the Deacon sleep longer (up to 10 min between patrols)\n- Active work wakes the Deacon immediately via the feed\n- No polling or fixed sleep intervals\n\nIf context is HIGH:\n- Write state to persistent storage\n- Exit cleanly\n- Let the daemon orchestrator respawn a fresh Deacon\n\nThe daemon ensures Deacon is always running:\n```bash\n# Daemon respawns on exit\ngt daemon status\n```\n\nThis enables infinite patrol duration via context-aware respawning.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-18T13:09:16.293379+08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-18T13:09:16.293379+08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hq-wisp-tm7","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-3qa","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-18T13:09:16.302114+08:00","created_by":"deacon"},{"issue_id":"hq-wisp-tm7","depends_on_id":"hq-wisp-aba","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-18T13:09:16.311431+08:00","created_by":"deacon"}],"ephemeral":true}
